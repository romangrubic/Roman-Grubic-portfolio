# Roman Grubic

## Welcome to my portfolio

Are you looking for a Full-stack Developer that can ACTUALLY do both Front-end and Back-end and all in between? With attention to details but not slow as tortoise? Who can write documentation and make commits that makes sense instead of some gibberish non-sense? 
A developer on whom you can count? 

Check out my portfolio below (yes, picture is actually a link for a website) and see if I fit the profile you are looking for. Even if I don't fit, send a message and we can sort something out.

## Project Background

Welcome to my portfolio web-site. Goal of this site is to promote myself and my skills to future employers and recruiters. It contains a little bit about me and more about my projects that represent my skill. There are both source code links to my Github for each project and a live demo link which will bring you to the project itself.

### Strategy

Portfolio web-site purpose is to promote myself and my skills to employers and recruiters.

### Scope

In designing this page, I wanted for the employer/recruiters to have a positive experience and for the web-site to be simple to use. 
With only one click, they can see all my projects or read my CV. I don't want to waste time by uneccessary details. Quick and readable was the main goal.



### Structure
When they open my prtfolio web-site, they can immediatelly see my name and profession. Clean and readable. Below that, there are icons which
are used as a quick link to my Github, LinkedIn, contact modal and CV, respectively. After that they have option buttons , from where they can see
my projects and short description about me. 

On project section, my main projects are represented as cards with their name, an image showing a quick-peek of the project as well
that it is responsive, a short description of the projects purpose, main technologies used in creating and link to both Github repository and live demo.
And again there are buttons which will lead them to about me section or back to top.

About me section is short and precise with information about me, what was I doing before, my skills and technologies I learned and a CV icons.
And again there are buttons which will lead them to project section or back to top.
