# Roman Grubic

## Welcome to my portfolio

Are you looking for a Full-stack Developer that can ACTUALLY do both Front-end and Back-end and all in between? With attention to details but not slow as tortoise? Who can write documentation and make commits that makes sense instead of some gibberish non-sense? 
A developer on whom you can count? 

Check out my portfolio below (yes, picture is actually a link for a website) and see if I fit the profile you are looking for. Even if I don't fit, send a message and we can sort something out.
